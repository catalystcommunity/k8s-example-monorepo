# auth_api

This is a FastAPI based example project providing authn and authz functionality (at a basic level) for a monorepo example run in k8s with multiple services/tools.

See [the github repo](https://github.com/catalystcommunity/k8s-monorepo-example) for the rest of the project.

This sub-project should contain tests that use an actual postgres db but the only requirements for testing or running are environment variables.
